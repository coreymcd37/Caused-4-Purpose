### CAUSED SOFT OPEN + VIDEO CALL ###

First online webinar scheduled for November 15th so far we have about 12-15 new people that have confirmed they were going. We are looking forward to the soft opening/ plus Q&A. If anyone is interested please send me a PM on GitHub and we will send you links to the private video chat.

Again this is for testing and a soft open, constructive criticism is expected as well as thoughts and ideas. Early access and extended benefits will be given as well.
Thank you for your time and support.
