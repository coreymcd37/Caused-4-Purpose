# Caused-4-Purpose

Connecting the dots between communities, businesses, non profits, and giving them all opportunity to grow within themselves in their local cities.  In other words it would be a win win situation for all parties involved.  We are looking forward to serving the greater good with opportunities and solutions.

**DECEMBER NEWS UPDATE**

I personally had the chance to Connect with a family member that lives in another major city and has made great connections in his area with influencers and marketing gurus.  He created a brand that blew up and now we will be working together.  All and all its one more step forward, but for me this is the heart of what we are trying to do, and thats bring people/families together for a purpose and a cause greater than ourselves.  (I havent spoke to my brother in years so this was a most welcomed surprise.)  Im also super proud of him and how he has become a responsible straping young man. Life is good!  * Only 329 million more people to go but, its all down hill from here at least.  :) 

Also early this month, we Partnered with a well know business guru and nutritionist that holds many patents that will help usb network and connect the dots for a mutually positive benefit and awareness campaign.  All to take place and start after the new year.  Then I can relay more details to everyone.

We are all Looking forward for this and much much more,
Have a wonderful holiday and a Merry Christmas!
